The next two questions refer to the following:

Cell class reference:

public class Cell {
    public Cell(){
    }
    public char content;  // The character in this cell.
    public Cell next;     // Pointer to the cell to the right of this one.
    public Cell prev;     // Pointer to the cell to the left of this one.
}

The following method is supposed to move one node to the right in a doubly linked list of Cells but it contains a flaw.

The global variable 'currentCell' is a pointer to a Cell in the list.

1    public void moveRight() {
2           if (currentCell.next == null) {
3                Cell newCell = new Cell();
4                newCell.content = ' ';
5                newCell.next = null;
6                newCell.prev = currentCell;
7                currentCell.next = newCell;
8                currentCell = currentCell.next;
9                }
10        }
